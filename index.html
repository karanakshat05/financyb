    <div><p>Here are some tips you must know</p></div>
    <main>
    <div><p><h2>1. Consider Your Clicks.</h2>Making sure not to click on any links is the best defense against malicious ones. Even if you are certain that the in question link is legitimate, the only way to be absolutely certain that you are secure is to refrain from engaging. Go directly to your financial firm's website or use their app to verify they supplied the information rather than clicking, responding to, or downloading an attachment from an unknown source or opening a suspicious email. Your chance of downloading malware onto your device and exposing your personal data increases every time you interact with fake communications.</p></div>
    <div><p><h2>2. Employ Secure Passwords.</h2>Never divulge your passwords to third parties or leave them unsecured. For every account you have, use a unique password, and change it frequently. Consider utilizing a password manager—an application that secures online accounts by recommending and storing unique, strong passwords for each account—to keep track of and safeguard your numerous passwords. Well-known manufacturers of mobile devices and storage solutions provide password managers.    </p></div>
    <div><p><h2>3. Make multifactor authentication available.</h2>By enabling MFA, you can dramatically lower the risk of a cybercriminal gaining access to your account. MFA gives a higher level of security than single-factor authentication (such as a password) by requiring two or more different sorts of factors, such as a password and a text message code, a physical identifier, or a biometric like a fingerprint, voice, or facial recognition.</p></div>
    <div><p><h2>4. Keep Device Security up to date.</h2> If you do online financial transactions, you really need security software packages with antivirus, anti-spam, and spyware detection tools. Utilize current security software and set it up to receive automatic updates and patches. Install security updates for all your devices as soon as you get a notification that they are available. For advice on how to verify and enhance your system's security, visit the websites of your computer hardware and software providers. Additionally, do extensive research on the provider and its security practices if you're thinking about storing your private financial data in the cloud. Before you sign a contract, make sure they employ MFA and data encryption and that you are aware of all of the expenses. Also, make sure you understand the terms of service.</p></div>
    <div><p><h2>5. Use your personal device.</h2>If at all possible, refrain from accessing your financial accounts on devices or laptops that aren't your own. Software on public computers may record PINs and passwords, which can then be accessed by others. In the event that you do use a different computer, make sure to log out of your account before deleting your "Temporary Internet Files," "Cache," and "History." As well as protecting your mobile devices and any financial apps you use, use strong passwords, passphrases, or biometrics.</p></div>
    <div><p><h2>6. Browse attentively.</h2>Always choose a safe website when accessing your financial accounts online. In addition to having a key or closed padlock in the status bar, a secure website address begins with "https" rather than just "http". A new browser should be used if you need to access another website while connected into your accounts. Avoid multitasking on several webpages. Without it, you can leave yourself open to "session stealing." To end access to your account when finished, always click the "log out" option. Others might be able to access the website and read your financial information if you merely close your browser or enter an other web address.</p></div>
    <div><p><h2>7. Use Wi-Fi safely at all times. </h2>Many public hotspots, including wireless networks in hotels, restaurants, and airports, lower their security levels to make it simpler for anyone to access these networks. But this also makes it more likely that someone will steal your information. Some hackers even establish their own public networks with names that appear recognizable in an effort to entice unwary internet users. Slow connections or networks that do not request your agreement to their terms of service are warning signs. To access your financial accounts, hold off until you have access to a reliable, encrypted network. Additionally, when using Wi-Fi at home, make sure to use the best encryption and password combinations to protect your network.    </p></div>
    <div><p><h2>8. Look over all correspondence from your financial institutions.</h2>When your monthly account statements and account activities become accessible, carefully review them. Make certain that your financial institution has your most recent contact information and that you consistently receive statements. In the event that you discover an error or unauthorized activity in your account, get in touch with your financial institution very away.</p></div>
